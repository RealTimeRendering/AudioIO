	Graph for this node is shown in the following paper:

		Beat Frei - Digital Sound Generation (Appendix C: Miscellaneous â€“ 1. DC Trap)
		ICST, Zurich Uni of Arts.

	Essentially, a DCTrap removes the DC offset or DC bias
	from the incoming signal, where a DC offset is elements
	of the signal that are at 0Hz.

	The graph is as follows:

		   |---<---<|   input
		   |		|	  |
		   -> z-1 -> -> negate -> -> out
		   |					 |
		   |<-------------- *a <-|


	The a, or alpha, value is calculated is as follows:
		`a = 2PIfg / fs`

	Where `fg` determines the 'speed' of the trap (the 'cutoff'),
	and `fs` is the sample rate. This can be expanded into the
	following to avoid a more expensive division (as the reciprocal
	of the sample rate can be calculated beforehand):
		`a = (2 * PI * fg) * (1 / fs)`


	Given an `fg` of 5, and sample rate of 48000, we get:
		`a = 2 * PI * 5 * (1 / 48000)`
		`a = 6.2831 * 5 * 2.08333e-05`
		`a = 31.4155 * 2.08333e-05`
		`a = 0.00065448853615`.
